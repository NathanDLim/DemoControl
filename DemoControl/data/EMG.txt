Electromyography (EMG) is the process of recording the electrical activity of the muscles. Muscles are made up of many muscle fibers that are innervated by motor units. Motor units are neurons that are connected to the central nervous system (CNS), which is the control center for muscle movement. When the motor unit sends an electrical impulse to the muscle fibers, the muscle contracts. The EMG signal is made up of a summation of electrical impulses that propagate along the muscle. The higher the contractile force, the higher the amplitude. The signal can be measured using surface electrodes on the skin placed over the largest area of the muscle, where the signal is strongest. Unlike an electrocardiogram signal (a.k.a. the signal of your heartbeat) the EMG signal is non-reproducible. EMG is beneficial in measuring muscular performance for sports rehabilitation, training, surgical procedures, and studies in medical research and ergonomics.
