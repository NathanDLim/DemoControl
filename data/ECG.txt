Electrocardiography (ECG) is the process of recording electrical activity of the heart. The heart is made up of four chambers; the upper two chambers are called the atria, and the lower two chambers are called ventricles. A heartbeat normally starts in the right atrium, where an electrical impulse is created from the hearts natural pacemaker. This electrical impulse propagates throughout the heart, causing the heart to contract and pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.

ECG can be measured using surface electrodes that are placed on the skin. There are many different electrode placement methods that are used in various medical applications, but for the purpose of this demonstration, ECG will be measured across the heart from skin contact with the hands. The signal obtained is known as a PQRST curve. The PQRST curve will always have the same shape, but the ECG signal of each person is unique, like a fingerprint. ECG can be used to monitor heart health and help in the diagnosis of heart disease.
